        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p class="epunda-slab-inform"><i>The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is one of the most important spiritual and philosophical texts of India. Composed in Sanskrit, it forms part of the great Indian epic, the Mahabharata (Book VI â€“ Bhishma Parva). The text consists of 700 verses presented in the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer and spiritual guide.<br>The setting of the Gita is the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before the commencement of a great war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Faced with the moral dilemma of fighting against his own relatives, teachers, and friends, Arjuna is overcome with doubt and despair. In response, Krishna imparts timeless wisdom, addressing the nature of duty, righteousness, the self, and the ultimate purpose of life.<br>The teachings of the Gita emphasize concepts such as selfless action (Karma Yoga), knowledge (Jnana Yoga), devotion (Bhakti Yoga), and meditation (Dhyana Yoga). It is regarded not only as a sacred scripture of Hinduism but also as a universal guide to life, offering practical and philosophical insights that remain relevant across cultures and eras.</i></p>
